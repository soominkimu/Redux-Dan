# Redux-Dan
##### Dan Abramov's egghead lecture codes

#### 1. The Single Immutable
> #### 1st principle of Redux
> The entire *state* of the application will be represented by one JavaScript object.
#### 2. Describing State Changes with Actions
> #### 2nd principle of Redux
> The state tree is read only. Any time you want to change the state, you have to dispatch an *action*.
#### 3. Pure and Impure Functions
#### 4. The Reducer Function
> #### 3rd principle of Redux
> To describe state mutations you have to write a function that takes the previous state of the app and the action being dispatched, then returns the next state of the app. This function is called the *Reducer*.
#### 5. Writing a Counter Reducer with Tests
#### 6. Store Methods: getState(), dispatch(), and subscribe()
#### 7. Implementing Store from Scratch
```javascript
const createStore = (reducer) => {
  let state;
  let listeners = [];
  const getState = () => state;
  const dispatch = (action) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
  };
  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    return() => {
      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
    }
  };
  dispatch({});   // dummy dispatch
  return {getState, dispatch, subscribe};
};
```
#### 8. React Counter Example
#### 9.10. Avoiding Array Mutations with concat(), slice(), and ...spread / Object.assign() and ...spread
#### 11.12. Writing a Todo List Reducer (Adding & Toggling a Todo)
#### 13.14.15. Reducer Composition with Arrays, Objects, and combineReducers()
#### 16. Implementing combineReducers() from Scratch
```javascript
const combineReducers = (reducers) => {
	return (state = {}, action) => {
		return Object.keys(reducers).reduce(
			(nextState, key) => {
				nextState[key] = reducers[key](state[key], action);
			return nextState;
			},
			{}
		);
	};
};
```
#### 17.18.19. React Todo List Example (Adding, Toggling, and Filtering Todos)
#### 20.21. Extracting Presentational Components (Todo, TodoList / AddTodo, Footer, FilterLink)
#### 22.23. Extracting Container Components (FilterLink / VisibleTodoList, AddTodo)
#### 24.25.26. Passing the Store Down Explicitly via Props / Implicitly via Context / with <Provider> from React Redux
#### 27.28.29. Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (VisibleTodoList / AddTodo / FooterLink)
#### 30. Extracting Action Creators
